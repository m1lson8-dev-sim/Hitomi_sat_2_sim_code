Adaptive Control System Simulation — Case Study

Language: Python 3.10 + NumPy + Plotly  

This repository contains simulation scripts developed for the case study on **adaptive attitude control systems** for spacecraft.  
The work demonstrates fault detection and recovery behavior using a simplified satellite model inspired by real on-orbit incidents.

Two main simulation setups are included:
1. ACS (Hitomi-like) — reproduces fault propagation leading to mission failure.  
2. Proposed Adaptive ACS — demonstrates improved stability, recovery, and fault isolation.
